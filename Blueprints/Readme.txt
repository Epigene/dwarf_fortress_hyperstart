Pack contains three modules:
-Dining
-Quarters
-Workshops
-Catacombs

The way I build my fortress, starting from surface layers is:
-Surface
-Farm
-Export, Food, Wood stockpile level [Use workshop module's Pile sheets]
-Workshop level [Use workshop module's Shop sheets]
-Stone, Metal, Furniture etc. stockpile level [Use workshop module's Pile sheets]
-Dining level [Use Dining module]
-Several sleeping quarters levels [Use Quarters module]

Notes:

Digs can be designated all at once and portions of them cancelled to spare precious digging time initially.

Build and Query sheets are smaller and cover the seperate windmill segments, allowing seperate building (and requiring less total pieces of furniture to complete successfully).

Choose file with Alt+F
Start designation by hidding d, centering and Alt+D

The first line of the spreadsheet should look like this:

#dig This is a comment.
The keyword "dig" tells Quickfort we are going to be using the Designations menu in DF. The following build phase keywords are understood:

dig     Designations menu (d)
build   Build menu (b)
place   Place stockpiles menu (p)
query   Set building tasks/prefs menu (q)

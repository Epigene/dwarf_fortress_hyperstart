# Dwarf Fortress Hyperstart
Hyperstart is an opinionated fork of the [Lazy Newb Pack](http://lazynewbpack.com) - the defacto best collection of tools and configuration for Dwarf Fortress, the fantasy world simulator / game for *windows*. It's aim is to improve accessability and ease of play by providing more useful configuration and defaults for core functionality.

Hyperstart aims to improve the experience for new players with these key features:

1. No setup - download, unzip and immediately play
2. Better key bindings for navigation

## Installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/Epigene/dwarf_fortress_hyperstart/archive/master.zip) this repo
2. Unzip
3. Open the `_Launch` folder and see if you can launch (in order specified)
    1. Soundsense (yay for sounds and music!)
    2. DwarfFortress (should run with the DFHack plugin automatically)
    3. Quickfort
    4. Dwarf Therapist
4. Once DF is running, pick "Continue Playing" and the pre-made band of dwarves will be leaded to do your bidding.

## Bindings
DF is verbose - reading the menus will usually reveal what keys do what, however navigation can be tricky, this is why navigation keys have been moved to the _left side of the keyboard_.
`1` and `2` move up and down menus respectively.
`3` and `4` move up and down Z-levels respectively.
Arrow keys and PageUp/PageDown are used to navigate menus where numbers will not work.
Numpad can also be used.

## More advice
This is 2015. [Boatmurdered](http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/), while a valuable and entertaining read, does not represent the sate of DF for years now, chefly because the game is 3D now, spanning countless depth levels from treetops all the way down to the bottom.
DF has a steep learning curve. It is akin to flying a plane - one must have a solid understanding of almost everything it can do to even do the most basic thing, which is still awesome.
It is recommended to watch a _recent_ "lets play" video to see what DF is all about and how simple things like digging stairs up and down Z-levels are done.
Feel free to experiment, read through the menus and google for advice. [Double-slit piercing aquifers](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.34:Double-slit_method) and [Making artificial waterfalls](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.34:Waterfall) will come in time.
